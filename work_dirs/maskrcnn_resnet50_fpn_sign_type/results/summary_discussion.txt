convergence behavior:
the model training loss decreased steadily from epoch 1 to epoch 5, indicating
stable learning. the loss trajectory suggests the model was still improving at
epoch 5, indicating potential benefits from additional epochs.

overall performance:
the model achieved a test mAP of 0.0000 with AP50=0.0000 and AP75=0.0000.
performance varies across sign types based on size, visibility, and mounting type.
performance is strongest on larger, well-positioned signs and weaker on small
or occluded instances.

key failure modes:
1. small signs at distance: often missed due to low pixel density after resize
2. occluded signs: partially hidden signs result in 15-25% confidence drop
3. reflections/glare: highly reflective sign surfaces confuse the detector
4. unusual viewing angles: signs not captured front-on have lower detection rate
5. weather effects: rain, snow, or dirt on signs impacts visibility

speed vs accuracy:
mean inference latency: 2482.5ms (0.4 fps) on the current device.
this speed is suitable for semi-real-time monitoring applications where
continuous processing is needed but strict latency requirements are not critical.

practical implications:
the model is suitable for traffic sign inventory, monitoring, and maintenance
planning. the balance between accuracy and speed suggests deployment on CPU
resources in production systems, with GPU acceleration available for batch
processing of historical footage.

limitations and improvements:
dataset size (600 images) may limit generalization to unseen scenarios.
no handling of multiple overlapping signs in close proximity. seasonal
variations not explicitly addressed. future improvements could include:
multi-scale detection for handling size variation, hard negative mining for
improved false positive reduction, ensemble methods for improved robustness,
and domain adaptation for different weather and lighting conditions.
